This is a modified version of LordDude's FGOA objset Noesis plugin: https://github.com/LordDude/FGOA_objset/

All credits go to him and any contributors who created the script, this is merely my space for tweaking the script to fit my needs. It should be noted that this is being done with Source engine compatibility in mind, so there will be differences between loading models with this and the original plugin!

# To Do
- Change bone orientation for proper Source support
- Character/Stage name printing in console(?)
- Automatically fix bone hierarchy for unparented bones

# Fixed Texture Previews
